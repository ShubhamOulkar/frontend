Users should be able to:

- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned ?

- 1. I used createContext(), useContext(), useState() react hooks for designing three step theme toggler.
- 2. localStorage to store and update theme.
- 3. This toggle btn is a unique component which uses checkbox three states to toggle. (checked, unchecked, indeterminate)
